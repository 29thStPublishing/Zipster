# reference
this app is a [http://code.google.com/p/ziparchive/wiki/PageName ziparchive] proof of concept.  it's packaged with a .zip file, then it unzips it and shows an image from the zipped directory. (i already know the file names so I cheat -- i'm just trying to unzip something successfully.)

# things i did to a new project to get zipster to work

1. Added the ZipArchive files

2. added libz.1.1.3.dylib framework

3. added things to the xib,
